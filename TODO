* Koji

** Immediate scratch build purging

   Implement an option (boolean flag) for Koji build RPC call which
   once set for scratch builds would make Koji delete build results
   (except for logs) immediately after build is completed.

   Advantages: reduces storage usage for Koji

   See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130233
   See: https://fedorahosted.org/koji/ticket/284

** SRPM repo generation

   Make new repo Koji tasks generate YUM repositories for source RPMs
   in addition to binary RPMs.

   Advantages:
    * a lot of code removed
    * reduced network usage
    * other (not Koschei related)

** Policy for scratch builds from repo ID
